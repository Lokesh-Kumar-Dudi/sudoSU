**sudoSU** is a Free Software package written using [python](https://www.python.org/), [PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and **BASH**. It is designed to utilize [SeisUnix (SU)](https://github.com/JohnWStockwellJr/SeisUnix/wiki) programs installed by user to process **Seismic Data**. It is developed for Linux based systems and  supports **Ubuntu 18.04 or higher** and other **Gnome** based **Linux** Distributions. It provides user with an intuitive UI to execute multiple commands by just a few clicks instead of the tedious Command Line Interface for ***SeisUnix*** and knowledge of BASH scripting. It is a modular package and can be easily extended/modified by the end user. It can be used to develop a module for any linux command that can be run on terminal since it uses a [Terminal Emulator](https://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/index.html#Vte-2.91/classes/Terminal.html#Vte.Terminal)  to process the commands. It supports batch processing, Workflow creation and execution using **BASH** scripts for SU/SEGY files.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Project started as a result of my desire to learn **python** and evolved over time from simple **tkinter** project to what it is now.
